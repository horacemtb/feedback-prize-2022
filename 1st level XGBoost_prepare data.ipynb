Some schools said students should not attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. For example, a teacher said students are more lazy and Generic_Name said students don't take classes seriously. In my opinion I think that taking classes at home will be a big problem because students don't do what they supposed to do and also some time students just look at Google to answer what the teacher told to them. Students are not working hard to get want they want, some just said i want to be this or that but they don't put effort in on. Schools believe that students who take classes at home by way of online or video conferencing are not learning enough. For example, people think students become more interested in other things because they are at home and they can do whatever they want. Generic_Name said that students don't do homework when they attend to an school ,they will not do it at home either. In my opinion all that this people are saying is true because students don't see that what they are doing now can affect they life in the future, because if they to have a diploma they will never have a good job. I think that those schools that want students to take classes at home are making students to be more lazy than they are. Although some schools said students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students need more time to sleep. A reason is that students need to rest they mind so students can be prepare for the next day of class. Another reason is that students need to sleep at least 9 hours because they always went to bed late. In my opinion students need to sleep well because it is good for our self to sleep the correct hours not too little and not too much. At this time some schools offer a distance learning program that will let students attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students can eat more deathly food. A example is that the president said that all the students have the right to have a good nutrition. A doctor also said students need a good nutrition because having a good nutrition students can absorb all the learning process. In my opinion this is a good idea because student can have a better nutrition at they on home. Having a good nutrition will make students more strong and they will be able to do many things. In my position i think students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will never put interest in what the need to do. This idea will just cause problems because is a lie that students will be connected to computer to take the classes. It is not the same to take classes at home that at school because at school students can ask the teacher if they have a question and teacher do what ever she/he need to do to make sure students understand it. To give students the opportunity have classes at home is like give students the option to take classes or not. I believe that finishing schools is a great goal in life is like the firth step to more big stuffs. Some schools said students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. I think that is the best because is not good for the students to take classes at home. Those schools who believe students should not take classes at home is because they want the beast for all the students.\",\n          \"the use of a car limit using can help in different ways as it could help us save the planet from a greenhouse effect or improve safty as it woul be a lower chance to get into a car crash with can result in injury or death but with limit usage it would make the wourld a better place and here to explain why limit usage is good. in the story its says that as the population grows more in american they has to be a production in cars to help the person to get to one place to another. but however in january 1995 many americans were cash-strapped due to the decrease in driving along with the unemployed wasnt going to work aanyways as they try to recover underway. in another story it tells how people could live without cars but in germany as one of the family said \\\"when i had a car i was always tense and im happier this way. As studys show that 70% of familes do not own cars but as well are happy just by walking or riding a bike beacuse cars make up the greenhouse gas. While in the vauban homes are being adopted in order to provide transportation with less spaced parking then walking all of the way to the mall. in america the agency of environmental are staring to promote and also want a \\\"car reduced\\\" area where they can help perserve the wild life as 80% of the law has gone to the highway and the other 20% is the transport its self. In other places they have a car-free day which means no cars or transport will be used through out the day as many people would take a bike or walk or even hike as one person said \\\"its a good opportunity to take away stress along the pollution in the air\\\" as it shows that there should be a limited usage of cars. As this could impact the world along with the enviorment around it. the care usage limited idea is good because it helps people support the enviorment along with decreasing greenhouse gas and smog as people will either take a bike or walk to get from place to place without having the traffic jam struggle.\",\n          \"\\\"What is the Electoral college?

Some schools said students should not attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. For example, a teacher said students are more lazy and Generic_Name said students don't take classes seriously. In my opinion I think that taking classes at home will be a big problem because students don't do what they supposed to do and also some time students just look at Google to answer what the teacher told to them. Students are not working hard to get want they want, some just said i want to be this or that but they don't put effort in on. Schools believe that students who take classes at home by way of online or video conferencing are not learning enough. For example, people think students become more interested in other things because they are at home and they can do whatever they want. Generic_Name said that students don't do homework when they attend to an school ,they will not do it at home either. In my opinion all that this people are saying is true because students don't see that what they are doing now can affect they life in the future, because if they to have a diploma they will never have a good job. I think that those schools that want students to take classes at home are making students to be more lazy than they are. Although some schools said students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students need more time to sleep. A reason is that students need to rest they mind so students can be prepare for the next day of class. Another reason is that students need to sleep at least 9 hours because they always went to bed late. In my opinion students need to sleep well because it is good for our self to sleep the correct hours not too little and not too much. At this time some schools offer a distance learning program that will let students attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students can eat more deathly food. A example is that the president said that all the students have the right to have a good nutrition. A doctor also said students need a good nutrition because having a good nutrition students can absorb all the learning process. In my opinion this is a good idea because student can have a better nutrition at they on home. Having a good nutrition will make students more strong and they will be able to do many things. In my position i think students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will never put interest in what the need to do. This idea will just cause problems because is a lie that students will be connected to computer to take the classes. It is not the same to take classes at home that at school because at school students can ask the teacher if they have a question and teacher do what ever she/he need to do to make sure students understand it. To give students the opportunity have classes at home is like give students the option to take classes or not. I believe that finishing schools is a great goal in life is like the firth step to more big stuffs. Some schools said students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. I think that is the best because is not good for the students to take classes at home. Those schools who believe students should not take classes at home is because they want the beast for all the students.\",\n          \"the use of a car limit using can help in different ways as it could help us save the planet from a greenhouse effect or improve safty as it woul be a lower chance to get into a car crash with can result in injury or death but with limit usage it would make the wourld a better place and here to explain why limit usage is good. in the story its says that as the population grows more in american they has to be a production in cars to help the person to get to one place to another. but however in january 1995 many americans were cash-strapped due to the decrease in driving along with the unemployed wasnt going to work aanyways as they try to recover underway. in another story it tells how people could live without cars but in germany as one of the family said \\\"when i had a car i was always tense and im happier this way. As studys show that 70% of familes do not own cars but as well are happy just by walking or riding a bike beacuse cars make up the greenhouse gas. While in the vauban homes are being adopted in order to provide transportation with less spaced parking then walking all of the way to the mall. in america the agency of environmental are staring to promote and also want a \\\"car reduced\\\" area where they can help perserve the wild life as 80% of the law has gone to the highway and the other 20% is the transport its self. In other places they have a car-free day which means no cars or transport will be used through out the day as many people would take a bike or walk or even hike as one person said \\\"its a good opportunity to take away stress along the pollution in the air\\\" as it shows that there should be a limited usage of cars. As this could impact the world along with the enviorment around it. the care usage limited idea is good because it helps people support the enviorment along with decreasing greenhouse gas and smog as people will either take a bike or walk to get from place to place without having the traffic jam struggle.\",\n          \"\\\"What is the Electoral college? In the history, talk electoral college. The electoral college consists of the selection of the eletors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the couting of the electoral votes by congress. also, the electoral cogelle consists of 538 electors. a majority of 570 electoral votes is requiered to elect the president. According with the test, i agree because all the candidates generally hace responsabilities . so, they need to demostrate to the people that them can have good ideas for the state. then the people need to have a vote for the best candidate for that can pass to be the new president of the state. each candidate have many obligations with the state the obligation president is better the state. one \\\"evidence is each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors\\\" in conclusion, i think that is good be president of a state but a president have many obligations that to accomplish.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"discourse_len\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
